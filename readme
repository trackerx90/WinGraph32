
WinGraph32 - Graph Visualization Tool for MS Windows
====================================================

WinGraph32 tool reads a textual and readable specification of a graph and
visualizes the graph. It layouts the graph using several heuristics as
reducing the number of crossings, minimizing the size of edges, centering of
nodes. The specification language of WinGraph32 is GDL, Graph Description
Language.

WinGraph32 is a port of the VCG tool to MS Windows. Some functionality
has been removed during the porting process.
